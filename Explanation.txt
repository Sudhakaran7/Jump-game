Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], 
check if you can reach to any index with value 0.
Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Input Description:
First line contains, N and Start as integers as input.(1<N,start<100)
Second line contains, N elements of integers in array.

Output Description:
Print True or False.

Sample Input:
7 5
4 2 3 0 3 1 2

Sample Output:
True

Explanation:
All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: 
index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

6 4
2 8 0 4 5 1

Sample Output:
False
